# idna_mapping

This crate is not meant to be used directly. It is part of the unicode-rs back end for the `idna` crate providing the UTS 46 mapping data and an abstraction over JoiningType data (delegated to `unicode-joining-type`).

See the [README of the latest version of the `idna_adapter` crate](https://docs.rs/crate/idna_adapter/latest) for how to use.
